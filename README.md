# Terminal Chaos - User Edition 
Chaos is taking over, and the heretics are emerging. The Emperor calls for aid, and our fellow space marine has been stranded on the desolate planet Arrakis-dex. With nothing but a handbook and an imperial plasma gun in hand but the courage and the strength of an astarte, survive the hostile yet lifeless prison. GLORY TO THE EMPEROR!<br>
Make sure to collect and store all the codes of weapons, artifacts and keys to your handbook folder and push the changes to your repository “amfoss-tasks” after every part, i.e. after every new code you acquire.
## Part 1
Check your current location using the command pwd. A deadly sandstorm, Vortex of Desolation, is impending. Get to safety before it catches up!!!<br>
The Eolian caves are dark indeed. You sense air coming from some hidden path. Light up the room using a more powerful ls command. Explore the mysterious cave more to find hints and puzzle pieces that will lead you to your destiny.<br>
Hint: When faced with identical paths make use of `du -h -d 1` to analyze the depth of the paths. Follow the path with the least depth.

Once you have reached the deepest end of the entrance, run **sy.py** before you move forward with the task.
Seek out the elusive document that only has read-only permissions for the user.

Get the hidden code from the file and store it in the Handbook ...

## Part 2
You have got a promising lead. The secrets of the sealed realms are slowly coming to light.<br>
Use `git checkout <branch name>` to switch between realms overriding the seals.Explore the realms and lookout collectibles and ciphers in various chambers. BEWARE of hostile flora, fauna and potential dungeon Bosses. 
### Kharnok the Bloodforged
Kharnok the Bloodforged, a malevolent entity shrouded in the icy depths of Arrakis-Dex, emerged from the unholy fusion of ancient chaos rituals and the raw power of the Warp. Kharnok’s symbiotic relationship with his weapon, Bloodreign, is his strength and weakness. Timing the parries to disarm the boss and using holy magic to cleanse the corruption is an effective strategy indeed.<br>
Use linux command to search for all **“holy good”** herbs. Then replace each letter in the encoded phrase with the letter that comes before it. Concatenate the herbs with the first one being the word containing ‘oo’ in it. Remove all vowels from the final code and voila, you have made yourself a holy spell.

### Celestial Veil Amulet
Forged in the celestial forges of Sigmaron, the Celestial Veil Amulet is a relic born of divine intervention to combat the malevolent forces that threaten the balance of existence. When worn, the Celestial Veil Amulet emanates a radiant glow, warding off malevolent influences and shielding the bearer from the corrupting touch of the Chaos.<br>
Dropped by Khanrock the Bloodforged. Use the Celestial Veil Amulet to unlock “corrupted” files in the Dark Branch. 

## Part 3
The first part of the book has been acquired. The Dark realm awaits you. The air is thick with the noxious fumes of corruption, and the ground beneath is stained with the ichor of the damned. And here, beyond the ominous shadows and malevolent forces, lies the gateway to the second half of the scriptures…<br>
It seems the chaos has ripped apart space time itself of the Dark Realm. Traversing through these unforgiving environments might be impossible, but the Celestial Veil serves as the beacon for the lost Astarte. Use the Celestial Veil Amulet to unlock “corrupted” files to be found in Dark Realm I and II.
### The Shadowforged Blade of Eclipsar
This dark and ominous weapon is said to be forged in the heart of Umbrafall, bathed in the corrupted energies that permeate the accursed realm. The blade is known for its ability to absorb and channel the malevolent forces that linger within Umbrafall, granting its wielder the power to unleash devastating attacks and tap into the shadows themselves. However, the allure of such power comes at a cost, as the blade hungers for the life force of those it strikes, leaving a chilling and haunting aura in its wake.<br>
Truly a handy and effective weapon against the heretics.

## Part 4
Now, in possession of both halves of the corrupted book, the time has come to unite the separated halves, to forge a union that transcends the fractured abyss. However, an unforeseen conflict arises as the halves reveal a corruption that resists even the sanctifying influence of the **Celestial Veil Amulet**.<br>
Resolve conflicts in the “corrupted” branches **DarkBranch I and II** by editing the files and then merge them. Gather and combine all the codes you have acquired and decode it to get the link to the GodSuite repository. Clone this repo to continue with the next part of the task.

## Part 5: Welcome to GodSuite
As the beacon of hope resurrects to its true glory, the **GodSuite** branch is born. The book represents the young boy himself. Each commit, a distinct chapter, encapsulating the trials, growth, and eventual transcendence. The word **"portal”** acts as a key, a thread that weaves through the narrative, revealing the location of the machine that propelled the boy toward his godly destiny. Check through all commits, and you might also meet the same fate..
